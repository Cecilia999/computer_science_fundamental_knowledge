## 1. Process vs Thread 进程与线程之间有什么区别

1. Definition :

   - Process is an instance of a program in execution
   - Thread is the unit of CPU utilization
   - Thread is more lightweight than Process

2. creation and termination:

   - Process and Thread are using different system call to create and terminate. e.g. process is created by fork() system call, thread is created by pthread_create() system call
   - process take more time to create and terminate than thread
   - if a process is failed, it will not affect other processes. however, if a thread faield than the belonging process failed.

3. structure and resources:

   - Process and thread have different structure: **process = have its own address space + data segment** vs **thread = shared data and resources with other threads belonging to the same process**
   - Process consume more resources and does not share resources in the same way as threads does

4. communication:

   - Process and thread use different communication model
   - It is more complicate and cost more time to communicate between Process than Thread.

5. context switch:
   - Process consume more time and resources than thread when context switch.

## 2. what is ipc?

Inter process communication (IPC) is used for exchanging data between multiple threads in one or more processes. The Processes may be running on single or multiple computers connected by a network. The full form of IPC is Inter-process communication.

- Operating systems provide facilities/resources for inter-process communications (IPC), such as message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.
- Distributed computing systems make use of these facilities/resources to provide application programming interface (API) which allows IPC to be programmed at a higher level of abstraction. (e.g., send and receive)
- Distributed computing requires information to be exchanged among independent processes.

## 3. 什么时候选择多进程什么时候选择多线程

1. 需要频繁创建销毁的优先用线程
   因为 memory allocation and process creation is costly

2. 需要进行大量计算的优先使用线程
   大量计算，要耗费很多 CPU，和频繁 context switch

3. 强相关的处理用线程，弱相关的处理用进程
   thread share operating resources, if task are strong related than it is prefer to use multithreading

4. across machines use multiprocessing, multiprocessor architecture use multithreading

## 4. 线程的通信方式

- 互斥锁 Mutual exclusion (Mutex) / binary semaphore
  防止多线程同时读写同一块区域，保证资源独占

- 信号量 counting semaphore  
  允许同一时刻多个线程访问同一资源，但是需要控制同一时刻访问此资源的最大线程数量。一旦大于限制的数量，其他线程只能等待

- 信号 signal  
  通过通知操作的方式来保持多线程同步，还可以方便的实现多线程优先级的比较操作。

## 5. 常用 linux 查看进程/线程状态的命令行

1. ps

   **ps 命令行的 documentation page**: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html

   1. ` ps -a - 列出所有运行中/激活进程`
