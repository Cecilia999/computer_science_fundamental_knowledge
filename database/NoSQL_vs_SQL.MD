# SQL VS NoSQL 关系型 vs 非关系型数据库

1. 关系型数据库:(SQL)
   MYSQL, Oracle, Sql Server, DB2, Sqllite
   通过表和表之间,行和列之间的关系进行数据的存储 e.g.学员信息表,考勤表
2. 非关系型数据库:( NOSQL) Not Only
   Redis, Mongdb
   非关系型数据库,对象存储,通过对象的自身的属性来决定。

### Write down the differences between NoSQL and RDBMS?

Following is a list of the differences between NoSQL and RDBMS: –

1. data format:
   In terms of data format, NoSQL does not follow any order for its data format. Whereas, RDBMS is more organized and structured when it comes to the format of its data.

2. scalability:
   When it comes to scalability, NoSQL is more very good and more scalable. Whereas, RDBMS is average and less scalable than NoSQL.

   Relational database or RDBMS databases are vertically Scalable When load increase on RDBMS database then we scale database by increasing server hardware power ,need to by expensive and bigger servers and NoSQL databases are designed to expand horizontally and in Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources.

3. join clause:
   For querying of data, NoSQL is limited in terms of querying because there is no join clause present in NoSQL. Whereas, querying can be used in RDBMS as it uses the structured query language.
4. storage mechanism:
   The difference in the storage mechanism of NoSQL and RDBMS is that, NoSQL uses key value pair, documents, column storage, etc. for storage. Whereas, RDBMS uses various tables for storing data and relationships.

## SQL - structured query language

## NoSQL - Not Only SQL
